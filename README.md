# Preference Signaling

If you have ever applied for a job, ordered an Uber, or asked someone out, you have played part in a [matching market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_matching_theory_(economics)). Matching markets are numerous and varied, but they all share one thing in common: they bring together various kinds of agents who care about whom they are paired with. Many such markets are becoming increasingly competitive. College admissions rates are at an all-time low (1), and medical students increasingly need to rank more residency programs to ensure a match (2). Economists have found preference signaling to be a useful tool in boosting one’s chances of matching with their preferred chooser (3, 4, 5).

As a young, single person, who has already gotten into college and is not pre-med, the matching market of relationships is of most interest to me. In 2014, Niederle and Lee conducted an online dating experiment in South Korea where participants were given a limited number of “virtual roses” they could use to “signal special interest when asking for a date.”  They found many interesting results, namely that roses increase the likelihood of matching.

The code in this repo attempts to simulate this experiment with agent-based modeling in Python.
